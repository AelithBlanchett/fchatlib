# FChatLib


Small library to work out with F-list's chat system.

There's already a working plugin example [here](https://github.com/AelithBlanchett/FChatBot-ExamplePlugin)

## How to start?

0. [Install Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open a console (Command invite on windows, or terminal on linux), then go to the directory where you extracted the files. (cd "C:\the\directory")
3. Type 'npm install fchatlib --save'
4. Let's start with the following app.js file.
`
var FChatLib = require('fchatlib');
var options = {username: "MyAccount", password: "MyPassword", character: "MyNewShinyRobot", master: "YourCharacter", room: "ADH-someid"};
var myFchatBot = new FChatLib(options);
`
Change the options variable, fill in your credentials, the character your bot show as, and the room ID where the bot will go first.
If you don't know how to get that room ID I'm talking about, just open F-chat, go into the room you want to bot in, type /openroom to open it, then /code to get the code.
The usual format for the code is like this: 'ADH-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
4. Type 'node app.js', and watch the bot appear in the room!
5. By default, there aren't any plugins loaded. The !help command will show you which commands are available.
!availableplugins will show the list of plugins in the /plugins folder.
!loadplugin pluginname will load the plugin /plugins/pluginname.js
Once the bot loads a plugin or joins a room, the bot will save and remember to connect to these rooms, and automatically load these plugins.
6. Type '!loadplugin my_plugin' in the chat, and it will tell you which commands it has loaded.
7. You should see that the !guide command has been added, so type it into the chat, and read its output.
8. Once you have read it, you're ready to go! You can create another plugin just by creating a new .js file in the plugins folder.
I'd advise you to copy/paste the [my_plugin]() plugin, and start from there. Remember to load it with !loadplugin yourplugin, and to
reload it with !reloadplugins


## Functions

### `Constructor`

Awaits the option parameter, with the following arguments:
```
var options = {username = "", password = "", character = "", master = "", cname = "", cversion = ""}
```
The required parameters are:

Username and password are your F-List's account's credentials,
character will determine which character on your account will be used for the bot,
master determines which character will have the privileges for rebooting, reloading and etc,

The optional parameters are:
cname is your bot's common name (surely used internally by F-list's),
cversion is the bot's current version (surely used internally by F-list's)
